## About GTasb3D

GTasb3D is a 3D thermophysical code using the General finite difference model to simulate the Thermal evolution of active small bodies. The features of this code includes:
* Capable of simulating various thermophysical processes involved in the transfer of heat fluxes, the sublimation/condensation of ice, and the diffusion of gas through a porous matrix within an icy body.
* Applicable to modeling a body with various kinds of shapes.
* Parallelized implimentaion in C++ with reasonable accuracy and efficiency.
More details on the mathematical formulate, code architecture, and validation tests can be found in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/PSJ/acc4c4">Zhang \& Hartzell (2023)</a>

## About this repository

Here includes the GTasb3D source code as well as an example with input files and MATLAB scripts. 

To compile the code, create a folder, e.g., "bin", in the top directory, type
```sh
cmake ../
```
This will generate a Makefile in the folder, and type
```sh
make
```
Voil√†!  You should find the executable file named "GTasb3D" in this folder, and now you can start to perform a GTasb3D simulation.

Steps to run GTasb3D:
* Copy the obtained GTasb3D to the simulation directory, e.g., example/133P.
* Edit "gfdm.dat" file to adjust the simulation setup and physical parameters.
* Create a folder named "result" in this directory and launch a simulation by 
```sh
./GTasb3D -n $NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS gfdm.dat
```
